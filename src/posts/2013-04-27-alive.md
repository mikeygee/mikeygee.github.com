It's pretty depressing to see that I haven't updated anything here in nearly a year. Obviously I'm not good at the whole blogging thing. I think I'm a decent writer, just very slow. I get overly self conscious at times and try to make things too perfect. I end up running out of time in the day and eventually abandon it.

Luckily(?), Twitter has forced my hand to do a site update, since they are nixing their public API and requiring authentication now. I opted to just use their iframe widget, which I'm not thrilled about, but it's easier to set up. Not that it really matters since I've tweeted 4 times in the past 8 months. I figured it was a good time to update the blog before a full year passed. Here's a lightning round of the past year:

<!--break-->

* Working hard on the next version of [OU Campus](http://omniupdate.com/products/). I've spent the last 12+ months redesigning interfaces and completely rearchitecting the front end code from scratch. I've gotten a lot better with [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/) and [jquery](http://jquery.com/) in particular. It's been enriching, enjoyable, and stressful all at the same time. There's still a lot of work left to do, but I'm pretty happy with the result so far.

* Ran the Disneyland Half Marathon, Oxnard Half Marathon, and LA Full Marathon. I'm not in the best shape of my life, but pretty close.

* [Wreck It Ralph](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772341/) was my favorite movie of 2012. [Avengers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/) and [Looper](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276104/) round out my top 3.

* Concerts/Shows: Muse @ Staples Center, Fun @ Wiltern, Fiona Apple @ Greek Theatre, Book of Mormon @ Pantages, Florence + The Machine @ Hollywood Bowl (best to worst)

I also recently checked my site analytics, and 75% of the traffic now is search referrals looking at either my technical posts or my essay on Vertigo. It used to be mostly from LinkedIn. I was surprised that my posts were coming up in search results. I'll try to gear future blog posts in the technical direction since that's what seems to be the most interesting and helpful to people.
