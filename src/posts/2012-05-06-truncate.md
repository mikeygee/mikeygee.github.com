title: truncating blog posts in Jekyll
---

I was working on my [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) [blog](/blog) page and noticed some funky output. It turns out that the content variable returns rendered HTML, and the truncate filter in [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) was cutting it off in the middle of a &lt;ul&gt; element. I had previously thought the filter operated on the unrendered markdown content.

I wanted a way to just display the first part of longer posts for the blog page without breaking/invalidating my HTML. I googled around and found a couple of hacks, but they seemed unnecessarily complicated. It turns out that a split function was added to the Liquid filters a few months back, so what you can do is insert an HTML comment into your posts, [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) on the comment, and just display the first element of the resulting array. If you don't need to truncate, it will display the full post. I had to update my local Jekyll to get the (not so) new split function.

	sudo gem update

<!--break-->
With the truncate filter, it will break in the middle of an HTML node
```
{% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}
	<div class="post-preview">
		<h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
		<div class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</div>
		{% if post.content.size > 2000 %}
			{{ post.content | truncatewords: 300 }} <!-- bad! content gives you rendered html and you will truncate in the middle of a node -->
			<a href="{{ post.url }}">read more</a>
		{% else %}
			{{ post.content }}
		{% endif %}
	</div>
	<hr>
{% endfor %}
```
Updated code with the split filter
```
{% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}
	<div class="post-preview">
		<h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
		<div class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</div>
		{{ post.content | split:'<!--break-->' | first }}
		{% if post.content contains '<!--break-->' %}
			<a href="{{ post.url }}">read more</a>
		{% endif %}
	</div>
	<hr>
{% endfor %}
```
In your posts file, put your marker wherever you want to cut off the post for the main blog page
```

UPDATE: Well now, this worked perfectly fine on local Jekyll, but after pushing to github pages, [it doesn't work](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/502). I guess for now, I will resort to one of the aforementioned [hacks](http://kaspa.rs/2011/04/jekyll-hacks-html-excerpts/).

UPDATE#2: Apparently this works now on GH pages. Thanks [Adam Ralph](http://adamralph.com/2013/01/09/blog-post-excerpts-a-new-solution/#update1).
