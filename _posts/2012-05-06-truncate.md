title: truncating blog posts in Jekyll
---

I was working on my [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) [blog](/blog) page and noticed some funky output. It turns out that the content variable returns rendered HTML, and the truncate filter in [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) was cutting it off in the middle of a &lt;ul&gt; element. I had previously thought the filter operated on the unrendered markdown content.

I wanted a way to just display the first part of longer posts for the blog page without breaking/invalidating my HTML. I googled around and found a couple of hacks, but they seemed unnecessarily complicated. It turns out that a split function was added to the Liquid filters a few months back, so what you can do is insert an HTML comment into your posts, [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) on the comment, and just display the first element of the resulting array. If you don't need to truncate, it will display the full post. I had to update my local Jekyll to get the (not so) new split function.
