And it never broke down on me, despite my subpar driving skills that put it through 4 accidents.</p>\n<p>Since 2011, I've lived within 2 or 3 miles of my workplace, so I started cycling to work. My car got less and less use, usually one or two short trips per week at the most. It seemed like a waste to pay for insurance and all the other costs of maintaining a car when I was using it so infrequently. Conventional wisdom says you need a car in LA, but with the rise of car sharing (Uber, Lyft, Zipcar) and delivery services (Amazon Prime/Fresh), it is starting to become more feasible to get by without one. As fate would have it, I got into an accident that while not too serious, caused enough damage to be a total loss. I was fed up with driving and didn't want to deal with it anymore. The insurance paid out $3500, and it was the perfect opportunity to try out life without a car. Instead of using the money to buy another car, I wanted to see how far it would take me using the alternatives. After 4 and a half months of this experiment, I've gotten by just fine and can confidently say that I prefer not owning a car.</p>\n","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"title":"living in L.A. without a car"},"fields":{"longDate":"October 4, 2015","shortDate":"Oct 4, 2015","slug":"/blog/carless"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"<p>Is a blog really a blog if you only update it once a year? Anyway for my annual site update, I'm doing a more personal post about my awesome cat River.</p>\n<p>River was born on June 5, 2013. Her mom was a stray found on the street, and fostered by a kind woman named Wendy. After taking her in, she discovered the cat was pregnant and soon gave birth to 3 kittens, all female. Right around that time, I decided on a whim that I wanted a pet cat to keep me company. I had been living in my own place since 2006, and while I'm an extremely independent person, we all get a little lonely sometimes. I've always been fond of furry animals, but was never allowed to have one as a kid, so I didn't know the first thing about how to care for one. Luckily the internet exists now, and a cat sounded like the perfect balance of a fun and low maintenance pet. I scoured craigslist for a few days, and eventually came across a listing with 3 adorable gray tabby kittens. There were two left when I went to meet them, one was very hyper, the other very chill.

Other times, people will be jostling for position, and the ref has to stop and make sure there are no violations. And then even if someone controls the tip, there's often a lot of contact among the other players, and it ends up going to the other team. The solution to this problem is simple. Just alternate possessions like they do in college. It's much simpler and more fair than a jump ball. The height and jumping ability of players involved in a held ball shouldn't dictate who gets it.

The biggest problem is with our over-zealous military. We spend about as much on military as the rest of the world combined, and we have troops in 130 countries. This is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind. Being the world police does not make us safer, and it's terribly expensive.

Obviously this disaster was a huge failure on the part of many people - policy makers, banks, ratings agencies. But ultimately, the investment bankers come across as the most unethical. There were a lot of stupid people involved that had no idea what they were doing, which is more of a policy failure.

The idea is if you need money, you have to put your stock up for sale. Whoever buys your stock is now a shareholder and has a say in your life decisions. If someone is successful, their stock price will increase, and all shareholders share in the success. So by everyone acting in their own self interest, everyone ends up better off. The trade off is that you lose your freedom until you are able to buy back the majority of your shares. If you don't have majority, then the shareholders decide where you live, work, go to school, etc. It's a very interesting idea for a political system that is highly efficient but comes at the cost of freedom.</p>\n","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"what i've been reading"},"fields":{"longDate":"October 21, 2011","shortDate":"Oct 21, 2011","slug":"/blog/reads"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"<p>I just happened to catch the Republican debate on CNN, and it inspired me to jot down some thoughts on politics.</p>\n<p>I've always hated politics.

It's a brief analysis of one of my favorite movies - Vertigo. This is full of spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, go watch it first, I highly recommend it.</em></p>\n<p>The word vertigo comes from the Latin word vertere, meaning \"to turn\". Dictionaries contain various definitions for vertigo, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dizziness; a reeling sensation; feeling about to fall</li>\n<li>An imbalance of equilibrium that usually causes a spinning sensation</li>\n<li>A confused, disoriented state of mind</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 film <em>Vertigo</em> tells the story of a man who experiences vertigo not only physically as a result of acrophobia, but also figuratively when he falls in love with a fabricated woman. Throughout the film, Hitchcock accentuates the cyclical and disorienting nature of vertigo explicitly with powerful visual images and a mystifying soundtrack, and also abstractly with recurrences and symbolism.</p>\n<p>The opening shot of <em>Vertigo</em> features a close up of a human eye. A spinning, hypnotic shape emerges from the eye and is accompanied by equally hypnotic music. This opening sequence hints that visual images will dominate the film for both the characters and the audience, taking them into another world. “We are thus immediately introduced to the world of the eye, gaze and seeing, the world where the film takes place and about which it narrates” (1).</p>\n<p>From the opening credits to the climactic conclusion, the audience is bombarded with various circular, spiral, and spinning images. The opening animations, the bouquet, Madeleine/Carlotta’s hair, the chandelier in the McKittrick Hotel which Scottie keeps staring at, the cross section of the sequoia tree, Scottie’s nightmare, the bell tower staircase – all of these concrete images along with the spiraling soundtrack convey the physical symptoms of vertigo, but more importantly, they also establish the idea of recurrence, a theme used extensively in this film. Locations and events from the past constantly repeat themselves, and the characters become trapped in this cycle, this state of illusion. In the final scene, Scottie says he wants to be “free of the past”. In other words, he wants to be free of his vertigo, both physically and figuratively.</p>\n","timeToRead":8,"frontmatter":{"title":"an essay on alfred hitchcock's vertigo"},"fields":{"longDate":"September 27, 2011","shortDate":"Sep 27, 2011","slug":"/blog/vertigo"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"<p>I am currently interested in joining a startup or small team, as a software engineer focused on <a href=\"http://agilemanifesto.org\">agile</a> web development.

I can't think of a single accomplishment from my job that I am really proud of and would want to tell someone about.</p>\n<h4>The standard procedure</h4>\n<p>Procedures are a necessary evil in corporate IT to keep things organized, but they often get more attention than the actual task at hand. You end up focusing more on clawing your way through the procedure than building what the client needs. Another problem is that they try to use one common procedure for too many things, and they err on the side of being more careful and going slower. It feels like trying to push a square shaped project through a circle shaped procedure. There are so many things you end up doing that make no sense and just waste time.

I bought the mikeygee domain name in 2005 with the intent of building a personal site and proceeded to procrastinate for the next 6 years. So why now? Well for one, this <a href=\"http://pages.github.com\">github pages</a> feature with <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a> looked pretty cool, and I had to try it. But mostly because I'm in a transitional phase in my career and trying a lot of new things as I figure out what to do next. So let's start with some goals for this blog.</p>\n<h4>Learn</h4>\n<p>Writing things down and publishing forces you to think in more depth than you normally would. It helps you understand yourself and the topic you are writing about more clearly and fully. I hope that blogging will help refine my knowledge and opinions.</p>\n<h4>Document</h4>\n<p>I have a terrible memory, and the Internet has only made this worse, as the answer to any question is a Google search away. I hope that blogging will help me better remember the thoughts and insights I discover.</p>\n<h4>Contribute</h4>\n<p>I've been an enormous consumer of the Internet for the last decade or so, but have so far failed to make any significant contributions to it. I've gained so much from online material, and it seems wrong to not give back. Some of the most interesting and insightful things I've read have come from personal blogs and user comments, and there's no reason why my writing couldn't have a positive impact on someone out there.</p>\n<h4>Speak</h4>\n<p>I am naturally introverted, and it has always been a challenge for me to break out of my shell. I hope that blogging will improve my confidence and allow people to get to know me through my writing.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"number one"},"fields":{"longDate":"August 31, 2011","shortDate":"Aug 31, 2011","slug":"/blog/one"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
