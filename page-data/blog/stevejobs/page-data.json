I knew in the back of my mind that this was coming, but the news still hit me really hard. It's sad and upsetting to lose such a brilliant mind that created immeasurable wealth for the world, but his spirit will live on in the amazing products we use every day.</p>\n<p>Steve, you've been an inspiration and role model to me and countless others. Thank you for working so hard to bring us technology that makes our lives better. You will be sorely missed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p526/mikey-gee/jonathan-mak-apple-design_zps9a59bfe4.png\" alt=\"steve jobs apple icon\"></p>","timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"id":"7903bade-bc27-5b72-a9c1-a1c2499fa6b9"}}}
