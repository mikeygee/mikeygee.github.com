Maybe I should just make this an annual thing.</p>\n<p>This year I decided to spend part of my July 4 break updating my site to look better on mobile devices. It's pretty clear that mobile is going to overtake desktop usage pretty soon, if it hasn't already. When I'm at home, I do most of my browsing on an iPad now, unless I have something else to do that requires the desktop. I originally designed my site with only desktop in mind. The cool thing about updating for mobile, is that it encouraged me to simplify things, and overall I'm happier with the more basic and minimal look. I also added a light theme for easier reading. It's a pretty ghetto client side only implementation, so you might see some flashing, but for the most part it works ok. So go ahead, take a look at the site on your phone or tablet if you're not there already!</p>","timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"id":"1f30f562-8a6d-5306-983f-3967a93477d1"}}}
