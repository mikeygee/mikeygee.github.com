	<h2>about</h2>
	<p>My name is Michael "Mikey" Gee (pronounced like the letter G). I am a 28-year-old programmer, born and raised in the Los Angeles area, and currently living in Ventura County, California.</p>
	<p>I discovered computer programming when I was 18 and knew right away that I had found my calling. There is something magical about writing code and watching it work, that fascinates me more than anything else. I love building apps and learning new software technologies. My current interests are mainly in programming for the web and mobile devices.</p>
	<p>I also have a lot of interest in business and economics, especially startups and investing. I love the startup culture and hope to one day start my own company. I also enjoy trading in the financial markets and following my favorite companies.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I love to get outside and be active. I enjoy pretty much all sports, but my favorites are basketball, snowboarding, running, and cycling. I am a die-hard Lakers fan and love to watch competitive sports. I also like to watch movies and TV shows, and go to live music concerts.</p>
	<p>My philosophy on life can be summarized in 3 L's - learn, love, and laugh. I strive to challenge and improve myself a little each day, treat people with love and respect, and find ways to laugh and enjoy the little things.
